# Description
The project contains a sample workflow file that demonstrates how to use the depends feature in GitHub Actions to specify a job's dependency on the successful completion of other jobs.

The workflow includes four jobs that run on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS, respectively.

he windows job is dependent on the successful completion of the macos job, and the depends job is dependent on the successful completion of the ubuntu, windows, and macos jobs. 

Each job simply runs the date command, which outputs the current date and time.

# Workflow with Dependencies
The sample workflow file (dependant.yml) defines four jobs:

- ubuntu: runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
- windows: runs on the latest version of Windows and depends on the successful completion of the macos job.
- macos: runs on the latest version of macOS.
- depends: runs on the latest version of macOS and depends on the successful completion of the ubuntu, windows, and macos jobs.
Each job runs the date command, which outputs the current date and time.

The windows job is defined with the needs field, which specifies that it should only run after the macos job has completed successfully.

The depends job is defined with the needs field, which specifies that it should only run after the ubuntu, windows, and macos jobs have completed successfully.
