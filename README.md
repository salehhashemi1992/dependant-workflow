# Description
The project contains a sample workflow file that demonstrates how to use the depends feature in GitHub Actions to specify a job's dependency on the successful completion of other jobs. The workflow includes four jobs that run on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS, respectively. The windows job is dependent on the successful completion of the macos job, and the depends job is dependent on the successful completion of the ubuntu, windows, and macos jobs. Each job simply runs the date command, which outputs the current date and time.
